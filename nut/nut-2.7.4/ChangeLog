	* configure.ac: Fix autoreconf on Debian  For some reason, Automake
	  doesn't search the current directory correctly when searching for
	  helper scripts, when 'nut' is running as a git-submodule, as it is
	  the case with the website repository
	* configure.ac: update version to 2.7.4
	* drivers/apc-ats-mib.c: snmp-ups: add APC ATS input.source
	* drivers/snmp-ups.c: snmp-ups: fix the matching OID tests  For both
	  sysOID and classic methods, we used to test one of the two OIDs
	  provided in the mib2nut structures. However, these two OIDs
	  (oid_pwr_status and oid_auto_check) tend to be redundant and
	  confusing. Replace these matching by an extraction of
	  {ups,device}.model

	* configure.ac, tools/Makefile.am, tools/driver-list-format.sh: Check
	  driver.list[.in] format at make dist time  Instead of checking
	  driver.list.in at configure time, move the checking and
	  modification into a script that is called at make dist time. The
	  script can also be called manually, and will try to fix both
	  driver.list.in and driver.list

2016-03-03  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* docs/man/upsrw.txt, docs/net-protocol.txt: Clarification on NUMBER
	  type float values  Clarify a bit more documentation on how to
	  express float values, when using upsrw.  That is to say, using
	  decimal (base 10) english-based representation, so using a dot, in
	  non-scientific notation.  So hexadecimal, exponents, and comma for
	  thousands separator are forbiden
	* clients/upsrw.c, docs/net-protocol.txt, server/netget.c: Prefer
	  NUMBER to NUMERIC for variable type  As per discussion on the

	* data/driver.list.in: HCL: various TS Shara UPSes supported by
	  nutdrv_qx  Protocol: 'megatec' USB subdriver: 'sgs'
	* drivers/nutdrv_qx.c: nutdrv_qx: make sure 'sgs' USB subdriver uses
	  only what it reads  Since, in 'sgs' USB subdriver, we read only 8
	  bytes at a time and we expect the first byte to tell us the length
	  of the data that follows, make sure we don't use more than what we
	  read from the device in case the first byte is not what we expect
	  it to be.

	* clients/upsrw.c, docs/net-protocol.txt, server/netget.c: Default to
	  type NUMERIC for variables  Any variable that is not STRING, RANGE
	  or ENUM is just a simple numeric value. The protocol documentation
	  (net-protocol.txt) was previously stating that "The default <type>,
	  when omitted, is integer." which was not fully true, since a
	  variable could also be a float.  Hence, the wording was changed to
	  advertise this, and that each driver is then responsible for
	  handling values as either integer or float.  Moreover, instead of
	  returning a TYPE "UNKNOWN", return "NUMERIC", which is more
	  suitable, and aligned with the NUT protocol specification
	* tools/nut-snmpinfo.py: SNMP subdriver generator: fix output
	  formatting
	* tools/nut-snmpinfo.py: SNMP subdriver generator: discard commented

	  Switch (ATS), implement SNMP support for Eaton ATS.  Note that this
	  device can also be supported through Eaton XML/PDC (XML over HTTP)
	  protocol, supported by the NUT netxml-ups driver
	* data/cmdvartab, docs/nut-names.txt: Extend namespace for Automatic
	  Transfer Switch (ATS)  Extend NUT namespace to support a new type
	  of power device: ATS - Automatic Transfer Switch.  These devices
	  are used to setup 2 power systems, such as UPS, to power a single
	  power supply system, and be able to automatically transfer between
	  the input sources in case of failure of the primary one. The added
	  variable are for now limited to 'input.source' and

	  change slightly the way we publish protocol as ups.firmware.aux, -
	  update F's reply examples and some info_type (ratings;
	  output.frequency) in QX to NUT table to reflect reality, - increase

	  once. Also, increase version number.
	* drivers/nutdrv_qx_voltronic-qs-hex.c: nutdrv_qx: improve protocol
	  identification in 'voltronic-qs-hex'  Since 'V' protocol, in
	  reality, never happens to use the encoded version of the reply to
	  the QS query, but it always uses the plain version already
	  implemented in 'voltronic-qs' subdriver, remove it from the
	  identification process of 'voltronic-qs-hex' subdriver. Also,
	  remove some non-significant entries from the testing table and
	  increase version number.
	* drivers/nutdrv_qx_voltronic-qs-hex.c: nutdrv_qx: harmonize
	  declarations/definitions in 'voltronic-qs-hex'  In 'voltronic-qs-
	  hex' subdriver, the scope of support functions is limited to the
	  subdriver as rightly stated in forward declarations, so correct
	  their definitions to reflect that. Also, increase version number.

	  declaration for Eaton ePDU
	* drivers/eaton-mib.c: snmp-ups: 3-phase alarm handling for Eaton
	  ePDU  Eaton ePDU can now handle alarms on 3-phase, currently
	  limited to voltage and current, relative to the configured
	  thresholds
	* drivers/snmp-ups.c: snmp-ups: implement 3-phase alarm handling
	  snmp-ups now allows to publish 3-phase alarms in ups.alarm, the
	  same way as with outlet.  Declaration of such alarms are done using
	  "Lx.alarm". info_lkp_t structures messages are shared templates
	  with outlets, and use the string formats to include the context
	  (outlet or phase) and the number (of the outlet or phase) in alarm
	  messages.  These alarms are then published in "ups.alarm", with the
	  standard mechanism for alarm publication
	* docs/nut-names.txt: Extend 3-phase collection namespace with alarms
	  3-phase data collection now allows to specify alarms, the same way
	  than with the outlet collection ("outlet.n.alarm"), but using
	  "Lx.alarm" (for example "L1.alarm").  These alarms are then
	  published in "ups.alarm", with the standard mechanism for alarm
	  publication
	* drivers/eaton-mib.c: Advanced threshold handling for Eaton 3-phase
	  ePDU  Eaton ePDU can now handle warning and critical thresholds
	  settings and status for input voltage and current on 3-phase units.
	  Alarms are however still to be implement
	* docs/nut-names.txt: Extend 3-phase collection namespace with
	  threshold  3-phase data collection now allows to specify low / high
	  warning and critical thresholds for voltage and current. Status
	  relative to the thresholds also exist for these data

2015-09-07  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/snmp-ups.c, drivers/snmp-ups.h: snmp-ups: fix loss of
	  precision when setting values  su_setvar() was losing precision
	  when converting and casting the provided values to send to the SNMP
	  agent. As an example, with an OID in millivolt (multiplier set to
	  0.001), when providing 238 (V) using upsrw, the value sent to the
	  SNMP agent was 237999, so leaking 0.1 volt

2015-09-04  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/dstate.c: Extend ups.alarm internal buffer to 1024 chars
	  Currently, ups.alarm can hold up to 256 chars to expose alarms.
	  With the recent outlet alarms handling addition, the buffer may
	  quickly be to small.  Thus, increase to 1024, which may still not
	  be sufficient but already provides a bit more room
	* drivers/eaton-mib.c: snmp-ups: outlet alarm handling for Eaton ePDU
	  Eaton ePDU can now handle alarms on outlets, currently limited to
	  outlet voltage and current, relative to the configured thresholds
	* drivers/snmp-ups.c: snmp-ups: implement outlets / PDU alarm
	  handling  snmp-ups now allows to publish outlets and PDU alarms in
	  ups.alarm, the same way as with ups.status.  Declaration of such
	  alarms are done using the outlet template mechanism
	  ("outlet.%i.alarm"). info_lkp_t structures messages can also use
	  the string formats to include the outlet number in alarm messages.
	  These alarms are then published in "ups.alarm", with the standard
	  mechanism for alarm publication
	* docs/nut-names.txt: Extend outlet collection namespace with alarms
	  Outlet data collection now allows to specify alarms, using the
	  template definitions ("outlet.n.alarm").  These alarms are then

	* drivers/snmp-ups.c, drivers/snmp-ups.h: Fix default SNMP retries
	  and timeout  The previous patch was using the default values from

	* drivers/tripplitesu.c: tripplitesu: Fix initialization when
	  tripplite firmware is buggy  With some Tripplite SU1000RT2U (and
	  possibly more) UPS's, a firmware bug causes a malformed response to
	  the very first command that is sent after the serial port is opened
	  following a warm or cold boot of the system. My theory is that this
	  related to either the RS232 data lines or handshaking lines being
	  pulled high once the server's UART is powered however I have not
	  determined precisely if this is related to the data line being
	  pulled high or the handshaking lines being asserted. However, I
	  have been able to consistently reproduce the issue where the driver
	  fails to start on the first attempt after a cold/warm boot across 3
	  different machines and 2 SU1000RT2U UPS's. To workaround this, the
	  initial enumeration is repeated a 2nd time after 300ms(to allow all
	  garbage data to arrive) if the first attempt fails, which allows
	  the driver to consistently startup successfully on the 1st attempt.

	  However, some newer Eaton units have a light HID descriptor at
	  index 0, and the full version is at index 1 (in which case,
	  bcdDevice == 0x0202). This dual report descriptor approach is due

	* docs/man/ups.conf.txt, drivers/dstate.c, drivers/dstate.h,
	  drivers/main.c: Implement synchronous driver flag  As per issue
	  #197, NUT drivers work by default in asynchronous mode. This means
	  that all data are pushed by the driver on the communication socket
	  to upsd (Unix socket on Unix, Named pipe on Windows) without
	  waiting for these data to be actually consumed.  With some HW, such
	  as ePDUs, that can produce a lot of data, asynchronous mode may
	  cause some congestion, resulting in the socket to be full, and the
	  driver to appear as not connected.  By enabling the 'synchronous'
	  flag, the driver will wait for data to be consumed by upsd, prior
	  to publishing more.  This can be enabled either globally or per
	  driver.

	* drivers/nutdrv_qx.c: nutdrv_qx: prevent a vicious loop when

	  unexpected (non-empty) answer and, after returning from
	  'qx_ups_walk()', it is not followed by at least one item using a
	  different 'command', the driver will loop endlessly using the same
	  'broken' answer instead of trying to get a new one from the UPS. To
	  solve this issue, make sure to have an empty 'previous_item' when
	  starting 'qx_ups_walk()'. Also, bail out of 'qx_ups_walk()' when a
	  'QX_FLAG_QUICK_POLL' item can't be preprocessed properly through
	  'ups_infoval_set()'.

	  Add new 'Q1' subdriver. This subdriver implements the same protocol
	  as the one used by the 'megatec' subdriver minus the vendor (I) and
	  ratings (F) queries. In the claim function: - it doesn't even try
	  to get 'vendor' informations (I) - it checks only status (Q1),
	  through 'input.voltage' variable Therefore it should be able to
	  work even if the UPS doesn't support vendor/ratings *and* the user
	  doesn't use the 'novendor'/'norating' flags, as long as: - the UPS
	  replies a Q1-compliant answer (i.e. not necessary filled with all
	  of the Q1-required data, but at least of the right length and with
	  not available data filled with some replacement character) - the
	  UPS reports a valid input.voltage (used in the claim function) -
	  the UPS reports valid status bits (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th are the
	  mandatory ones)  This commit reintroduces a functionality of the
	  blazer subdrivers that was lost because now, in order to tell
	  whether a device is supported by a subdriver or not, if the user
	  doesn't call the driver with the 'novendor' flag, both the status
	  (Q1) and the vendor (I/FW?) queries are needed (that's to better
	  discern the subdrivers).  Reference:

	  upsdrvctl retrying to start the driver in case of failure.  More
	  specifically, a mix of init system (V and systemd), udev and USB
	  device(s) can result in the /dev entry not being available at
	  driver startup, thus resulting in a general failure to start NUT.
	  This commit provides at least a way to overcome this issue. A more
	  suitable  solution will require more work on NUT design.  This

	  docs/new-drivers.txt, drivers/Makefile.am, drivers/al175.c: al175:
	  updated driver, please restore it  Back in 2005 I was young and
	  idealistic, that's why you finally marked al175 as 'broken', but
	  now I understand your points (some) and that in NUT you need good
	  portability.  So this time I've checked that al175 compiles with
	  CC="gcc -std=c89 -pedantic", and CC="gcc -std=c99 -pedantic"  Also,
	  I've tried to clean-up the driver based on feedback from 2009, but
	  unfortunately I no longer have hardware to test and will not have
	  any in foreseable future, so the driver was reworked to meet the
	  project code quality criteria, without testing on real hardware.
	  Some bugs may have crept in.  Changes since last posting in 2009:
	  - patch rebased on top of current master (v2.6.5-400-g214c442); -
	  added reference to COMLI communication protocol document; - status
	  decode errors go to log, instead of setting non-conformant status
	  like "?T", "?OOST", etc.  For such errors new loglevel is
	  allocated; - "High Battery" status is back; - converted tracing
	  macros to direct use of upsdebugx and numbers 1,2,3,4 for loglevels
	  as requested (but now lines got longer because of explicit __func__
	  usage); - lowered usage of other macros (e.g. REVERSE_BITS
	  inlined); - alarm(3) is not used anymore - instead whole I/O
	  transaction time budget is maintained manually; - man page
	  converted to asciidoc and supported variables list is merged into
	  it;  - upsdebug_ascii moved to common.c and to separate patch.
	  ~~~~  Changes since al175 was removed from NUT tree in 2008:  -
	  alloca was eliminated through the help of automatic variables -
	  debugging/tracing were reworked to (almost always) use NUT builtins
	  - al175 now uses 3 debug levels for (1=user-level info, 2=protocol
	  debugging, 3=I/O tracing)  - rechecked
	  http://eu1.networkupstools.org/doc/2.2.0/developers.html and
	  applied where apporpiate  Also  > This driver does not support
	  upsdrv_shutdown(), which makes > it not very useful in a real world
	  application. This alone > warrants 'experimental' status, but for
	  the below mentioned > reasons (to name a few), it's flagged
	  'broken' instead.  Yes, at present shutdown is not supported, and
	  unfortunately now I don't have AL175 hardware at hand, so that I
	  can't write it and verify the implementation.  I've marked the
	  driver as DRV_EXPERIMENTAL, although it was tested by us as part of
	  our systems to work OK for more than three years in production
	  environment on ships (and we don't need shutdown there -- in
	  critical situations the system has to operate as long as possible,
	  untill the battery is empty)  Also, all of the previous issues
	  listed below are now fixed in this al175 version:  - ‘return’
	  with a value, in function returning void (2x) - anonymous variadic
	  macros were introduced in C99 - C++ style comments are not allowed
	  in ISO C90 - ISO C forbids braced-groups within expressions (5x) -
	  ISO C90 forbids specifying subobject to initialize (16x) - ISO C99
	  requires rest arguments to be used (18x)  Yes, "All the world is
	  not an x86 Linux box," and I've tried to make all the world happy.
	  Please apply.  Thanks, Kirill.
	* common/common.c, docs/developers.txt, include/common.h: common:
	  upsdebug_ascii() - to dump a message in ascii  For debugging ASCII-
	  based protocols with control characters (e.g. COMLI) it is handy to
	  dump messages not in hex, but in ascii with human readable codes.
	  Add utility function to do it.

	  instcmd the UPS supports.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Use info_lkp_t structure for mapping
	  topology info  Make code simpler by using the info_lkp_t structure
	  for mapping value from topology block to text presented to user as
	  ups.description
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Cosmetic commentary fixes and remove some

	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Output unsupported alarms on debug level
	  3, not level 2  The supported alarms in alarm map is outputted at
	  debug level 2. The unsupported alarms should be outputted at debug
	  level 3, it is not that interesting. Also remove debug outputted
	  empty line after table heading line for meter map and alarm map.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Refactor code for setting which alarms
	  are supported, to avoid code duplication  Refactor the code which
	  checks the alarm map for supported alarms, by making a new method
	  which checks the alarm bit to see if the alarm is supported.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Only include ups.serial and device.part
	  if they have a value  Only set info about ups.serial and
	  device.part if the UPS actually report useful info for these.
	  Remove the handling of space characters as meaning string
	  termination for ups.serial, this is not done for part number, and
	  according to bcmxcp spec are these both 16 byte ascii text
	  messages. Move Nominal output frequence handling up, placing it
	  just below Nominal output voltage

	  this. The blazer man page is the same for both, with .so links for

	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Let decode_instcmd_exec also handle short

	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Add test.panel.start instcmd support
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Use one fuction to decode command
	  execution status in all places  To avoid duplicating the logic
	  which checks the status of command execution at UPS, add a new
	  function which contains the check, and use that function whenever
	  we send a command to UPS and get status back from UPS.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h: bcmxcp: Define byte for

	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Fix outlet number for

	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Let upsdrv_shutdown call instcmd for
	  shutting down  To avoid code duplication between upsdrv_shutdown
	  and instcmd, let the upsdrv_shutdown method first try to issue a
	  shutdown.return instcmd, and then proceed with shutdown.stayoff if
	  the shutdown.return failed. This seems to be in line with what the
	  usbhid driver does.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: report upsdrv_comm_good at successful
	  execution of instcmd
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: bcmxcp: Return more specific error codes from
	  instcmd  Use the available STAT_INSTCMD_FAILED and

	  applicable, instead of always returning STAT_INSTCMD_UNKNOWN or -1.

2013-07-03  Alf Høgemark <alf@i100.no>

	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h: bcmxcp: use command map if

2013-05-14  Bo Kersey <bo@vircio.com>

	* drivers/bestfcom.c: bestfcom: Use fc.idealbvolts for calculating
	  percent charge  'I have a Best Ferrups 3.1KVA and I noticed that
	  the percent battery voltage reported from upsc never gets above
	  69.9%.  I believe there is a mistake in the driver.  The battery
	  percentage is calculated based on the High Battery Alarm Setpoint
	  (59.6V) instead of the Ideal Voltage which is about 54V (4
	  batteries x 13.6V).  I examined the source code and found that the
	  variable fc.fullvolts is the result of querying parameter 67 from
	  the UPS.  This parameter is defined per Ferrups Tip 503 as: "The
	  battery voltage at which the UPS sound a High Battery alarm"  A
	  better value to use in determining the percent battery voltage
	  would be fc.idealbvolts which is calculated in the driver source...
	  I propose the following patch to fix the battery.charge (% battery
	  full) reading.'  Ref:

	* docs/nut-names.txt: Add device.uptime to nut-names.txt  Also fix
	  one typo.
	* docs/man/apcsmart.txt, drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: allow users to
	  select non-canonical tty mode  The main reason behind this addition
	  is windows compatibility, see
	  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.monitoring.nut.user/7762  IGNCR
	  has been readded earlier in commit
	  20c52bee77fa0b3ea3c7f8bec25afd103b7ff4a2 - this might be enough to
	  handle windows behavior, but if it's not the case - using non
	  canonical processing (same as is present in apcsmart-old) should
	  solve any pressing issues.
	* drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c: apcsmart: add device.uptime to vartab

2013-04-26  Michal Soltys <soltys@ziu.info>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.h: apcsmart: remove

2013-04-15  Michal Soltys <soltys@ziu.info>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c: apcsmart: change
	  approach to 2 digit compatibility entries  As reported in
	  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.monitoring.nut.user/7762 - 2
	  digit values reported through 'b' are really >255V voltage values.
	  So we match whole 00 - FF set as single (fake) compat entry.

2013-04-16  Michal Soltys <soltys@ziu.info>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: remove strchr() check from

2013-04-15  Michal Soltys <soltys@ziu.info>

	* drivers/apcsmart.h: apcsmart: re-add CR to ignore sets  Despite
	  icanon mode, windows (supposedly) is uncapable of ignoring CR in
	  fashion analogous to IGNCR flag.  See
	  http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.monitoring.nut.user/7762 for
	  rationale.
	* drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c: apcsmart: add regex format to
	  ambient.0.temperature  'T' might (on older units) also mean "ups
	  uptime", so we want to distinguish that case gracefully. The
	  formats are:  uptime: 000.0 temp: 00.00

	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  drivers/apcsmart_tabs.h: apcsmart: move variable regex matching
	  into vartab  This also allows us to properly validate (in near
	  future) cases when single apc variable can match multiple nut
	  variables.  Other changes:  - adjust rexhlp() to follow 0 for false
	  and non-0 for true, like in the rest of the functions - remove
	  valid_cmd() as rexhlp() can be used directly with formats in the
	  table; furthermore the warning (in case of failure) could be
	  confusing when we add nut:apc n:1 case

	* docs/man/snmp-ups.txt: Update SNMP driver documentation  Mentioning
	  'mib' is not needed anymore since NUT 2.6.2. Also mention 'v3' as
	  an allowed value for 'snmp_version' (reported by Tim Rice)

2013-01-29  Michal Soltys <msoltyspl-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  drivers/apcsmart_tabs.h: apcsmart: implement #311678 (multiple
	  values per variable)  This is a bit more general than the original
	  request.  All variables that return multiple comma-separated
	  values, are added as *.N.* where 1 <= N <= APC_PACK_MAX; the
	  variables are stored with temporary name *.0.* in apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  but only at least 1 and at most 4 are added per update run
	  (superfluous - if any - are removed), with *.0.* placeholder being
	  ignored.  We assume that the particular variables cannot belong to
	  the capability set at the same time (as reported by user) -
	  otherwise we will need a bit more complex handling, including
	  updates to all setvar functions.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h: apcsmart: update logging
	  logic / apc_read()  - logging  This mostly adds few macros that
	  implicitly use or pass caller's name (and in case of hard errors,
	  line number). This allows removal of a few "failed" / "succeeded"
	  lines (which in practice don't really happen), for example there is
	  no need for:  upslogx(LOG_ERR, "preread_data: apc_write failed");
	  as any hard error will be reported by apc_write() internally,
	  providing the place and line number it was called at.  Similarly,
	  some upslogx / upsdebugx calls were wrapped in analogous macros to
	  provide caller's name automatically.  Debug levels (-D) were
	  adjusted to require only one letter.  - apc_read()  It's been a bit
	  more scrutinized:  - filling up full caller's buffer is considered
	  an error; shouldn't happen unless the ups is somehow damaged or
	  some model is capable of returning more than 512 bytes in one read
	  (current max I witnessed is around 270 bytes during capability
	  read) - timeout reads (whether it's allowed or not) cannot really
	  have any non-0 count, though sanity check could theoretically be
	  useful in non-canonical mode; commented out code was added for
	  reference
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: enhance prtchr()  So it can handle 4
	  returns with static pointers.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: allow timeout on read in smartmode()
	  As this function is used to "nudge" ups, we should expect it to
	  timeout.  Also avoids extra log spam.

	* docs/Makefile.am, docs/new-drivers.txt, docs/snmp-subdrivers.txt,
	  scripts/subdriver/gen-snmp-subdriver.sh: Helper script to create
	  SNMP subdrivers stubs  Created a new shell script
	  (scripts/subdriver/gen-snmp-subdriver.sh) to automatically create a
	  "stub" subdriver. This will make it a lot easier and quicker to
	  create subdrivers for snmp-ups. A new documentation chapter has

	* drivers/tripplite-hid.c: Add support for newer TrippLite
	  Smart1500LCD  Add newer TrippLite Smart1500LCD (USB ID

	  cmd/var character is or isn't printable.
	* drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c: apcsmart: apc_cmdtab[] fixup  Earlier
	  commit that adjusted regex checks, also changed cmd fields for all
	  instant commands handled by custom functions. We cannot do that, as
	  they are not detected as supported this way.

	* drivers/mge-utalk.c: Improve mge-utalk general behavior  Make two
	  adjustments to improve the general behavior: first, send the double
	  "Z" prior to "Si" command. Second, inter-commands delay has been
	  increased to comply with the specification

2012-12-08  Michal Soltys <msoltyspl-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: serial related stuff a bit more
	  strict  Also:  - apc_flush() now loops with >0 condition (otherwise
	  errored apc_read() might cause inf loop) - ser_comm_good/fail()
	  were kind of missing in write wrappers
	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h: apcsmart:
	  sdlist/sdtype/advorder changes  - verify 'advorder' with regex -
	  remove unused defines - as the user is directed towards man page
	  either way (and without it numbers are kind of meaningless), drop
	  SDMAX
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: setup port after variable
	  sanitization in upsdrv_initups()
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: cleanup dstate ok/stale calls
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: getbaseinfo() fixup  In extremely
	  unlikely case of failing write, report it up and act accordingly.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  drivers/apcsmart_tabs.h: apcsmart: adjust regex logic  A bit
	  simpler / tighter now.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: add var_string_setup()  In theory
	  deprecate_vars() should also consider APC_STRING variables. In
	  practice - we don't have any variables that are both APC_MULTI and
	  APC_STRING - but it's more correct this way, so let's do it.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: cosmetics  - code shuffling,
	  comments, flow - rename query_ups() -> legacy_verify() - add few
	  lines of help directing to man page
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: simplify query_ups() /
	  proto_verification()  Both functions rely now on common variable
	  verificaion function.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: add var_verify()  The function will
	  be used in subsequent commit for common verification.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: shuffle two functions  query_ups()
	  and oldapcsetup()
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: simplify query_ups()  This commit
	  changes query_ups() function and makes it rely on the same
	  deprecate_vars() logic that protocol_verify() requires.  We can
	  shorten the code a bit now, and it allows us to do more
	  simplifications in subsequent commits.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: add functions informing about
	  [un]supported cmds/vars  In unified fashion, instead of each
	  protocol-verification related function doing it on its own.
	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h, drivers/apcsmart_tabs.c,
	  drivers/apcsmart_tabs.h: apcsmart: minor tidying up  comments,
	  trivial changes, code shuffling ...
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: remove unused field 'def' from cchar
	  In apc_ser_diff() reporting differences between
	  tcgetattr/tcsetattr, 'def' field was unused (along with related
	  defines).

	* docs/man/Makefile.am, docs/man/asciidoc.conf: Fix manpage
	  refmiscinfo attributes and multiple NAME  refmiscinfo attributes
	  were previously specified through asciidoc.conf. This approach
	  prevented from specifying and generating multiple manual pages from

	* configure.in: Only fail if SSL was explicitly requested
	  Configuration should not abort if neither OpenSSL nor Mozilla NSS
	  has been found, and if SSL was not explicitly requested by the
	  user. This fixes the Buildbot compilation failure on Aix (build
	  #206)

	  spellcheck-interactive), and an automated one (make spellcheck),
	  mainly for QA / Buildbot purpose. Note that a base NUT dictionnary
	  is also available (docs/nut.dict), providing a glossary of terms
	  related to power devices and management
	* drivers/tripplite_usb.c: Remove POD ("Plain Old Documentation")
	  With the approval of the author (Charles Lepple), remove POD
	  ("Plain Old Documentation"). This embedded documentation was
	  redundant, and is probably out of date, with respect to the
	  AsciiDoc version

	* drivers/apc-hid.c, drivers/apc-hid.h, drivers/libhid.c: Add a tweak
	  for APC Back UPS ES  APC Back UPS ES have a buggy firmware which
	  overflows on ReportID 0x0c, i.e.
	  UPS.PowerSummary.RemainingCapacity. This results in battery.charge
	  not being exposed and endless reconnections on systems with libusb
	  reporting EOVERFLOW. And it results on a failure to init the driver
	  for  systems with libusb not reporting EOVERFLOW but EIO (i.e. on
	  Windows).

	  to Eaton units  Eaton HID units (using usbhid-ups or [new,old]mge-
	  shut) were missing a data mapping to allow the change of the

	  on FreeBSD (reported by David Durieux)

	  NUT from Eaton website hosting  NUT is no more hosted by Eaton.
	  Arnaud Quette (NUT project leader) has taken over NUT hosting on
	  his own, to give NUT back some independance. This effort is also
	  part of a logic to stop crediting Eaton for contributions from
	  others (especially Arnaud Quette, as an individual). The new
	  hosting service is located, as for Arnaud's blog
	  (http://arnaud.quette.fr) on Gandi servers, using PaaS. This will
	  allow more flexibility and automation of the release process

	* drivers/apc-mib.c: APC SNMP MIB update and completion  Add
	  available high precision values, new variables
	  (input.transfer.reason, battery.current.total and ups.test.date),
	  and move ambient.{temperature,humidity}.{high,low} to ambient.1.*,
	  since they relate to alarm threshold of external probe 1 (patch
	  from Hong-Gunn Chew)
	* docs/nut-names.txt: Clarify the use of multiple ambient sensors
	  Multiple sensors can be exposed using the indexed notation.
	  'ambient.*', without index or using '0', relates to the embedded
	  sensor. For example: 'ambient.temperature' represent the embedded
	  sensor temperature. Other sensors (external, communication card,
	  ...) can use indexes from '1' to 'n'. For example:
	  'ambient.1.temperature' for the first external sensor temperature.
	* docs/nut-names.txt: NUT namespace completion  Add two new variables
	  'ups.test.date' and 'battery.current.total'. Also add a note on the
	  'ambient' collection for supporting multiple sensors

	* common/parseconf.c: Fix CVE-2012-2944: upsd can be remotely crashed
	  NUT server (upsd), from versions 2.4.0 to 2.6.3,  are exposed to
	  crashes when receiving random data from the network.  This issue is
	  related to the way NUT parses characters, especially from the
	  network. Non printable characters were missed from strings
	  operation (such as strlen), but still copied to the buffer, causing
	  an overflow.  Thus, fix NUT parser, to only allow the subset Ascii

2012-05-16  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* drivers/apcsmart.c, drivers/apcsmart.h: Final fix to the
	  tcsetattr() / tcgetattr() issue  The most likely cause of all
	  spurious differences between what was set on the port with
	  tcsetattr() and what tcgetattr() shows are likely to do with the
	  c_local PENDIN flag, which is a status bit, not a control bit. It
	  will change when there's unread pending input, which can be quite
	  often on an APC UPS.  The right way to compare struct termios
	  values is to clear the status flags _after_ the tcsetattr() and of
	  course after the tcgetattr() call and then compare the result with
	  what was set.  Also set NOKERNINFO, if available, as we don't want
	  the UPS or noise on the line to accidentally trigger status output
	  back to the UPS, and finally make sure IEXTEN is also cleared along
	  with ISIG since it too can cause weird things to happen.  This
	  change also adds some debug code to show any differences in the
	  structures in a logical manner in debug output (and squashes one
	  tiny compiler warning) (patch from Greg A. Woods)
	* docs/config-notes.txt, docs/man/upsmon.txt: Whitespace fixes
	  Remove some extraneous spaces, suggested by "git diff --check", and

	* drivers/libshut.c: Avoid stack corruption on invalid frame  In the
	  protocol, the frame size can be 8 bytes max. That is why the frame
	  buffer is only 8 bytes long. If the frame is corrupted, the size
	  read may be up to 15, which may corrupt the stack while writing
	  into the frame buffer. This patch add a simple sanity check on the
	  size to avoid a crash and enforce protocol limitation.
	* drivers/libshut.c: Fix SHUT variables read (from Arnaud Quette)
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c, drivers/bcmxcp.h, drivers/bcmxcp_usb.c: Change

	  this.
	* drivers/libshut.c: Deactivate UPS notification  Currently this
	  driver is ignoring notification by automatically sending NACK when
	  they are received. Nevertheless,this behavior creates communication
	  errors with some UPS (M2200). So this patch completly disable the
	  sending of notification from the UPS. Ideally we should correclty
	  implement notifications managment for optimal performance, but with
	  this patch, at least, communiaton works.

	* drivers/snmp-ups.c, drivers/snmp-ups.h: snmp-ups shutdown support
	  snmp-ups now provides support for UPS shutdown, based on usbhid-ups
	  mechanisms (composite commands and fallback). Composite commands
	  are also supported. This means, for example, that if
	  'shutdown.return' is not supported, a combination of 'load.off' +
	  'load.on' may be used.
	* drivers/ietf-mib.c: Fix invalid variable name  Beeper status
	  belongs to the 'ups' data collection
	* drivers/snmp-ups.c: Check validity of instant commands before

	* tools/nut-scanner/Makefile.am, tools/nut-scanner/nutscan-init.c,
	  tools/nut-scanner/scan_nut.c: Move libupsclient to weak runtime
	  dependencies  libupsclient, as other libraries used by nut-scanner,
	  is now a weak runtime dependency, through the use of lt_dl*()
	  functions. This means that libupsclient is not anymore required,
	  but only suggested. This should also solve the distcheck-light
	  compilation on Aix (on behalf of Frédéric Bohe, from Eaton)

2012-01-10  Michal Hlavinka <mhlavink@redhat.com>

	* drivers/dstate.c: do not forget to check send_to_one return value
	  send_to_one free()s connection, we can't use it after failure.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: do not call getinfo twice, use returned value for
	  parsing  result was stored, but never used. Another dstate_getinfo
	  call was used instead of stored value. Probably result of copy-
	  paste.
	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_xml_http.c: do not use unterminated string
	  in strlen  recvfrom returns raw data without null termination, this
	  string can't be used in strlen. Use number of recieved bytes
	  returned by recvfrom instead of strlen.
	* clients/upssched.c: do not send garbage on retry  because write and
	  read commands shared one buffer, on retry we did not send command
	  again, but last read data
	* drivers/tripplite_usb.c: prevent buffer overflow in hexascdump
	  haxascdump uses fixed size static buffer, but it had no checks to
	  assure result can fit into that buffer.
	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_nut.c: ups variable was allocated, but not
	  free()d
	* drivers/rhino.c, drivers/solis.c: use automatic time_t variable
	  instead of allocated one  time_t value is small enough to be
	  automatic variable instead of allocated one. It eliminates risk we
	  forget to free it again.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: do not forget to free pTmp  even if len is zero,
	  pTmp should be freed
	* drivers/mge-utalk.c: prevent null pointer dereference in strchr  in
	  some cases p can be null causing null pointer dereference of v
	  (initialized to 0) in strchr command
	* drivers/bcmxcp_usb.c: Fix condition in re-try loop making error
	  checking unreachable  for loop with condition retry <= MAX_TRIES
	  ends with retry = MAX_TRIES+1. This breaks following error check
	  with retry == MAX_TRIES condition, because it's true only in case
	  when last retry actualy succeeded.

	  IP v4 or v6 disabled kernel  (reported by Pavel Zubkou, Debian bug
	  #598741)
	* clients/Makefile.am: Fix forgotten update of libupsclient version
	  information  (bump from 1:0:0 to 2:0:1)
	* docs/man/bcmxcp.txt, docs/man/blazer.txt, docs/man/dummy-ups.txt:
	  Fix spelling and typo errors (patch from Laurent Bigonville,
	  Debian)
	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_xml_http.c: Fix remaining compilation errors
	  on FreeBSD, ...  ...due to missing <netinet/in.h> header inclusion

2011-09-26  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* tools/nut-scanner/nutscan-ip.c: Remove AI_NUMERICSERV...  ...since
	  it's useless and produces compile error on some systems.
	* tools/nut-scanner/nutscan-ip.h: Try to fix FreeBSD build

2011-09-23  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	  scanner/scan_snmp.c, tools/nut-scanner/scan_usb.c: Rework the whole
	  HAVE_<FEATURE> versus WITH_<FEATURE> logic, ...  ...which is not
	  suitable anymore since nut-scanner. Previously, we only defined an
	  automake variable (AM_CONDITIONAL) that allowed to compile coherent
	  set of features (a specific driver, for example). With nut-scanner,
	  we also need a pre-processor macro (AC_DEFINE) to manage code
	  activation inside of a feature. The NUT_REPORT_FEATURE macro has
	  been modified to handle all this logic

2011-09-23  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* tools/nut-scanner/nutscan-ip.c, tools/nut-scanner/nutscan-ip.h,

	  from ctype_t to nut_ctype_t.  This avoids namespace conflict on
	  AIX, and is more suitable in general

2011-09-18  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	  / section  (need to be generated after the distribution package)
	* drivers/nut-ipmipsu.c, drivers/nut-libfreeipmi.c: Don't override
	  PSU absence with the power failure flag
	* NEWS, UPGRADING, configure.in, docs/download.txt,
	  docs/website/news.txt: Final update for 2.6.2 release
	* docs/configure.txt: Complete the minimum FreeIPMI version required
	* tools/nut-scanner/.gitignore: Mark remaining generated files as

2011-09-15  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

2011-09-14  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_snmp.c: Remove use of strndup. This is not
	  supported on Solaris.

2011-09-14  Charles Lepple <clepple+nut@gmail.com>

	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_snmp.c: Remove unbalanced #endif
	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_snmp.c: nut-scanner: use "common.h", which
	  includes "config.h"
	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_snmp.c, tools/nut-scanner/scan_usb.c:
	  Include <string.h> for nut-scanner
	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_snmp.c: Silence redefined PACKAGE_ macro
	  warnings  This should be fixed properly upstream, but in the mean
	  time, the SNMP-based tools can't use these macros properly (since
	  they will have the values for Net-SNMP, not NUT).

2011-09-14  Frederic Bohe <fbohe-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* tools/nut-scanner/nutscan-ip.c: Get rid of s6_addr32 in IPv6 code

2011-09-12  Michal Soltys <msoltyspl-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/Makefile.am: apcsmart: minor Makefile.am change  Add
	  missing apcsmart_tabs.h
	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: limit comm-lost spam  In
	  upsdrv_updateinfo(), additional comm-lost messages were logged,
	  potentially causing unnecessary spam in logs. As ser_comm_fail()
	  and ser_comm_good() functions do so themselves (including rate
	  limiting), we changed the superfluous info to debug level and also
	  switched to upsdebugx().
	* drivers/apcsmart.h: apcsmart: add '+' to APC_UNR_CMDS  Only '-' is
	  used, and only internally by the driver - no need to inform in logs
	  about unrecognized command.
	* docs/man/apcsmart.txt: apcsmart: minor updates to apcsmart man page

	* tools/nut-scanner/scan_snmp.c, tools/nut-snmpinfo.py: Use the

	  matching SysOID is found.

	* drivers/apcsmart.c: apcsmart: revert back from custom serial

	  patch reverts the apcsmart back to relying on serial.c functions
	  for opening/closing and setting speed.  For the reference:
	  http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/nut-
	  upsdev/2011-June/005491.html  If it turns out that re-opening
	  serial ports during normal driver activity is really necessary, it

	  of concept),  ...with full USB support, and preliminary support for
	  NUT and Eaton XML/HTTP scan
	* drivers/liebert-esp2.c: Improved Liebert ESP II support, ...
	  ...including UPS shutdown (poweroff), 1 and 3-phase input and

	  Farkas Levente and Spiros Ioannou)
	* data/driver.list.in: Add Eaton Powerware 9140, using the serial

	  reformatted a bit.

2011-02-24  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* data/driver.list.in: Add several upscode2 supported devices that
	  were reported on the list:
	  http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/nut-
	  upsdev/2011-February/005281.html
	  http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/nut-
	  upsuser/2005-July/000031.html

2011-02-20  Arjen de Korte <adkorte-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* docs/man/ups.conf.txt, drivers/dstate.c: Variables that have an
	  override.<variable> in ups.conf are now really immutable.  They
	  can't be changed anymore (not even if they would have been R/W
	  otherwise). Rationale is, that if a user wants to override a value,
	  we should honor that request.  Added documentation accordingly (and
	  corrected previous commit).
	* docs/man/ups.conf.txt, drivers/dstate.c, drivers/main.c: Add
	  'ignorelb' flag to list of UPS fields in ups.conf...  ...to
	  override the LB condition reported by the UPS.  This allows all

	  early by setting this flag and battery.charge.low
	  (battery.runtime.low) in ups.conf.
	* data/driver.list.in: Removing subdriver setting  (cypress is auto
	  detected for this VID:PID combination, so there is no need to
	  specify this in usb.conf)

	  well. *

	  using unsigned SHA256 sum

2011-02-15  Arjen de Korte <adkorte-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* common/parseconf.c: In PCONF_CTX_t, argsize is an array of type
	  size_t values, ...  ...so instead of using sizeof(int *) we really
	  should use sizeof(size_t) for the size of individual elements

2011-02-15  Charles Lepple <clepple+nut@gmail.com>

	* data/driver.list.in: HCL: Re-add some devices to driver.list.in
	  from [[SVN:2516]]  These entries seem to have been dropped,
	  potentially due to the rename from driver.list to driver.list.in,
	  and the format change.

2011-02-11  Arjen de Korte <adkorte-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/libhid.c: Restore the nut-2.4.1 behavior for reading
	  reports from devices

2011-02-08  Arjen de Korte <adkorte-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	  [http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/nut-
	  upsuser/2011-January/006550.html]

2011-02-02  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

2010-11-30  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	* configure.in, docs/configure.txt: Change the default SSL
	  implementation to OpenSSL, ...  ...if both OpenSSL and Mozilla NSS
	  are present

2010-11-29  Arjen de Korte <adkorte-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* server/Makefile.am, server/conf.c, server/netcmds.h,
	  server/netssl.c, server/netssl.h, server/ssl.c, server/ssl.h,
	  server/upsd.c: Resolve namespace conflict with nss_compat_ossl

2010-11-28  Arjen de Korte <adkorte-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* clients/upsclient.h, m4/nut_check_libnss.m4, server/ctype.h,
	  server/ssl.c, server/ssl.h: Use the 'nss_compat_ossl' compatibility
	  layer...  ...to use the Mozilla NSS library instead of OpenSSL (we
	  might want to include native support in the future, but this will
	  at least allow a quick migration for testing purposes)

2010-11-26  Arnaud Quette <arnaud.quette@free.fr>

	  for sprintf with sizeof(buffer)

2010-10-20  Chetan Agarwal <chetanagarwal-guest@alioth.debian.org>

	* drivers/bcmxcp.c: - Add Device Part number reading from config
	  block.  - fix a few typo errors in comments, - Change driver
	  version to 0.25.
	* drivers/bcmxcp.h: define and use BCMXCP_CONFIG_BLOCK_PART_NUMBER
	  constant ...  ...for reading the Device Part Number from Config
	  Block
	* docs/new-names.txt: Add 'device.part' to list of supported
	  variables
	* data/cmdvartab: Add description for new variable added  -
	  'device.part'
