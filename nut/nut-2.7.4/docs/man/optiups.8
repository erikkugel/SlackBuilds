.SH "NAME"
optiups \- Driver for Opti\-UPS (Viewsonic) UPS and Zinto D (ONLINE\-USV) equipment
.SH "NOTE"
.sp
This man page only documents the hardware\-specific features of the optiups driver\&. For information about the core driver, see \fBnutupsdrv\fR(8)\&.
.SH "SUPPORTED HARDWARE"
.sp
\fBoptiups\fR was originally written against a PowerES 280es in nut\-0\&.45\&. It was revised for nut\-2\&.0\&.1 and tested against a PowerES 420E\&. It is expected to work with at least the PowerES, PowerPS, and PowerVS models\&.
.sp
This driver additionally supports a Zinto D from ONLINE USV\-Systeme AG because of their very similar commands, but it is unknown if it also works with other UPS from them\&.
.sp
This driver will not work with the PowerES stock serial cable\&. You will need to construct your own three conductor cable:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
UPS 6 \-> PC 3
UPS 9 \-> PC 2
UPS 4 \-> PC 5
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The cable for Online\-USV uses pin UPS 7 (not UPS 4) â†’ PC 5\&.
.SH "EXTRA ARGUMENTS"
.sp
This driver supports the following optional settings in the \fBups.conf\fR(5) file:
.PP
\fBstatus_only\fR
.RS 4
Only poll for critical status information\&. Without this,
\fBoptiups\fR
(and all NUT drivers) poll all sorts of information from the UPS fairly often\&. It is probably not often enough to hurt anything, so this option probably is not very useful, unless you have a flaky serial connection or a highly loaded machine\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBnowarn_noimp\fR
.RS 4
Does not print warnings when the UPS reports that a variable is not implemented or not pollable\&. Without the option you will get a message sent to your system logs each time NUT polls the UPS\&. If you specify
\fBnowarn_noimp\fR, this message will only be logged once\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBfake_lowbatt\fR
.RS 4
This forces the low battery flag true\&. Without it, if you want to test your UPS, you will have to unplug it and wait until the battery drops to a low/critical voltage level before NUT will respond and power down your system\&. With the flag, NUT should power down the system soon after you pull the plug\&. When you are done testing, you should remove this flag\&.
.sp
For basic shutdown configuration testing, the command
\fIupsmon \-c fsd\fR
is preferred\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpowerup\fR
.RS 4
Zinto D from ONLINE\-USV cannot be identified when switched to standby\&. Set this flag to allow the driver to power\-up your Zinto UPS\&. This will also power\-up your equipment connected to the UPS!
.RE
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
On the 420E, ups\&.serial and ups\&.temperature are unsupported features\&. This is not a bug in NUT or the NUT driver, just the way things are with this UPS\&.
