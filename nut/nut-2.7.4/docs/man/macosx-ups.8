.SH "NAME"
macosx-ups \- monitor for Mac OS X built\-in UPS and battery driver
.SH "NOTE"
.sp
This man page only documents the hardware\-specific features of the \fBmacosx\-ups\fR driver\&. For information about the core driver, see \fBnutupsdrv\fR(8)\&.
.SH "SUPPORTED HARDWARE"
.sp
\fBmacosx\-ups\fR supports any USB HID Power Device Class (PDC) UPS which is matched by the Mac OS X built\-in drivers\&. It also can monitor a laptop internal battery as though it were an UPS\&.
.sp
If the UPS is visible in the Energy Saver preferences pane of System Preferences, this driver should be able to monitor it\&.
.SH "EXTRA ARGUMENTS"
.PP
\fBport\fR=auto
.RS 4
Due to changes in the way that Mac OS X lists power sources, the
\fBport\fR
parameter no longer has any effect\&. The rest of NUT still requres a value here, and our traditional "don\(cqt care" value is
auto\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBmodel\fR=\fIregex\fR
.RS 4
Likewise, if you have more than one UPS, it may be necessary to specify a
\fBmodel\fR
name to match against\&. This parameter is also a case\-insensitive extended regular expression\&.
.RE
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.sp
If the driver cannot find an UPS, first open System Preferences and see if there is an "UPS" tab on the Energy Saver panel\&. If so, re\-run the driver with the \fB\-D\fR flag to list the names of the power sources found\&.
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS"
.sp
This driver is a monitoring\-only driver, and cannot shut down an UPS on its own\&. However, this should not be a problem in practice: it is monitoring the built\-in Mac OS X UPS driver, which has configuration options for several shutdown scenarios\&. Consult the Energy Saver control panel or \fBpmset\fR(8) for more information\&.
.sp
The default distribution of \fBapcupsd\fR installs a kernel extension which prevents Mac OS X from attaching to the UPS\&. In order to use this driver after installing apcupsd, you must first run the apcupsd\-uninstall script and reboot\&.
.sp
Note that other UPS monitoring solutions may show more detail than what is provided by the built\-in Mac OS X driver\&. In particular, voltages other than the battery voltage, as well as current and frequency, are typically not shown\&. It may be possible to monitor these values with \fBapcupsd\fR (for APC hardware only) or \fBusbhid-ups\fR(8)\&.
