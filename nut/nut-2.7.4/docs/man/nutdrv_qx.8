.SH "NAME"
nutdrv_qx \- Driver for Q* protocol serial and USB based UPS equipment
.SH "NOTE"
.sp
This man page only documents the hardware\-specific features of the \fBnutdrv_qx\fR driver\&. For information about the core driver, see \fBnutupsdrv\fR(8)\&.
.SH "SUPPORTED HARDWARE"
.sp
The \fBnutdrv_qx\fR driver is known to work with various UPSes from \fIBlazer\fR, \fIEnergy Sistem\fR, \fIFenton Technologies\fR, \fIGeneral Electric\fR, \fIMustek\fR, \fIVoltronic Power\fR (rebranded by many, many \- have I said many? \- others\&.\&. Long story short: if your UPS came with a software called \fIViewpower\fR, chances are high that it works with this driver with one of the \fIvoltronic*\fR protocols or with the \fImecer\fR one) and many others\&.
.sp
The NUT compatibility table lists all the known supported models\&. Keep in mind, however, that other models not listed there may also be supported, but haven\(cqt been tested\&.
.sp
All devices with a serial interface and many with a USB interface are supported\&.
.SH "EXTRA ARGUMENTS"
.sp
You may need to override or provide defaults for some values, depending on the make and model of your UPS\&.
.sp
The following are the ones that most likely will need changing (see \fBups.conf\fR(5)):
.PP
\fBondelay =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Time to wait before switching on the UPS (seconds)\&. This value is truncated to units of 60 seconds\&.
.sp
Note that a value below 3 minutes, may cause earlier firmware versions to not switch on automatically, so it defaults to 3 minutes (i\&.e\&. 180 seconds)\&.
.sp
This option provides a default value for
\fBups\&.delay\&.start\fR
that will then be used by the driver in the automatic shutdown sequence (i\&.e\&. calling the driver with the
\fB\-k\fR
option, calling
\fBupsdrvctl\fR(8)
with the
\fBshutdown\fR
option or when the
FSD
flag is set and
\fBupsmon\fR(8)
enters its shutdown sequence): however you can change this value \(oqon the fly\(cq for the actual session, only for the use with instant commands, setting
\fBups\&.delay\&.start\fR
with
\fBupsrw\fR(8)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBoffdelay =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Time to wait before shutting down the UPS (seconds)\&. This value is truncated to units of 6 seconds (less than 60 seconds) or 60 seconds (more than 60 seconds)\&. Defaults to 30 seconds\&.
.sp
This option provides a default value for
\fBups\&.delay\&.shutdown\fR
that will then be used by the driver in the automatic shutdown sequence (i\&.e\&. calling the driver with the
\fB\-k\fR
option, calling
\fBupsdrvctl\fR(8)
with the
\fBshutdown\fR
option or when the
FSD
flag is set and
\fBupsmon\fR(8)
enters its shutdown sequence): however you can change this value \(oqon the fly\(cq for the actual session, only for the use with instant commands, setting
\fBups\&.delay\&.shutdown\fR
with
\fBupsrw\fR(8)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBstayoff\fR
.RS 4
If you set stayoff in
\fBups.conf\fR(5)
when FSD arises the UPS will call a
\fBshutdown\&.stayoff\fR
shutting down after
\fBups\&.delay\&.shutdown\fR
seconds and won\(cqt return (see
KNOWN PROBLEMS), otherwise (standard behaviour) the UPS will call
\fBshutdown\&.return\fR
shutting down after
\fBups\&.delay\&.shutdown\fR
seconds and then turn on after
\fBups\&.delay\&.start\fR
seconds (if mains meanwhile returned)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBprotocol =\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Skip autodetection of the protocol to use and only use the one specified\&. Supported values:
\fIbestups\fR,
\fImecer\fR,
\fImegatec\fR,
\fImegatec/old\fR,
\fImustek\fR,
\fIq1\fR,
\fIvoltronic\fR,
\fIvoltronic\-qs\fR,
\fIvoltronic\-qs\-hex\fR
and
\fIzinto\fR\&.
.sp
Note that if you end up using the
\fIq1\fR
protocol, you may want to give a try to the
\fImecer\fR,
\fImegatec\fR
and
\fIzinto\fR
ones setting the
\fBnovendor\fR/\fBnorating\fR flags
(only one, or both)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpollfreq =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Set polling frequency, in seconds, to reduce the data flow\&. Between two polling requests the driver will do \(oqquick polls\(cq dealing just with ups\&.status\&. The default value is 30 (in seconds)\&.
.RE
.sp
If your UPS doesn\(cqt report either \fBbattery\&.charge\fR or \fBbattery\&.runtime\fR you may want to add the following ones in order to have guesstimated values:
.PP
\fBdefault\&.battery\&.voltage\&.high =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Maximum battery voltage that is reached after about 12 to 24 hours charging\&. If you want the driver to report a guesstimated
\fBbattery\&.charge\fR, you need to specify this (see
BATTERY CHARGE)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdefault\&.battery\&.voltage\&.low =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Minimum battery voltage just before the UPS automatically shuts down\&. If you want the driver to report a guesstimated
\fBbattery\&.charge\fR, you need to specify this (see
BATTERY CHARGE)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdefault\&.battery\&.voltage\&.nominal =\fR \fIvalue\fR, \fBoverride\&.battery\&.voltage\&.nominal =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Some devices show a wrong nominal battery voltage (or none at all), so you may need to override or set a default value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBoverride\&.battery\&.packs =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Some devices report a part of the total battery voltage\&. For instance, if
\fBbattery\&.voltage\&.nominal\fR
is 24 V, but it reports a
\fBbattery\&.voltage\fR
of around 2 V, the number of
\fBbattery\&.packs\fR
to correct this reading would be 12\&. The driver will attempt to detect this automatically, but if this fails somehow, you may want to override this value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBruntimecal =\fR \fIvalue,value,value,value\fR
.RS 4
Parameter used in the (optional) runtime estimation\&. This takes two runtimes at different loads\&. Typically, this uses the runtime at full load and the runtime at half load\&. For instance, if your UPS has a rated runtime of 240 seconds at full load and 720 seconds at half load, you would enter
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
runtimecal = 240,100,720,50
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The first load should always be higher than the second\&. If you have values available for loads other than 100 and 50 % respectively, you can use those too, but keep them spaced apart as far as reasonably possible\&. Just don\(cqt get too close to no load (prediction of runtime depends more on idle load for the battery then)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBchargetime =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
The time needed to fully recharge the battery after being fully discharged\&. If not specified, the driver defaults to 43200 seconds (12 hours)\&. Only used if
\fBruntimecal\fR
is also specified\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBidleload =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Minimum battery load used by the driver to estimate the runtime\&. If not specified, the driver defaults to 10%\&. Only used if
\fBruntimecal\fR
is also specified\&.
.RE
.SS "BESTUPS, MECER, MEGATAEC, MEGATEC/OLD, MUSTEK, Q1, VOLTRONIC\-QS, VOLTRONIC\-QS\-HEX, ZINTO PROTOCOLS"
.PP
\fBignoresab\fR
.RS 4
Some UPSes incorrectly report the \(oqShutdown Active\(cq bit as always on, consequently making the driver believe the UPS is nearing a shutdown (and, as a result, ups\&.status always contains
FSD\&... and you know what this means)\&. Setting this flag will make the driver ignore the \(oqShutdown Active\(cq bit\&.

.SH "BATTERY CHARGE"

Due to popular demand, this driver will report a guesstimated \fBbattery\&.charge\fR and optionally \fBbattery\&.runtime\fR, provided you specified a couple of the EXTRA ARGUMENTS listed above\&.
.sp
If you specify both \fBbattery\&.voltage\&.high\fR and \fBbattery\&.voltage\&.low\fR in \fBups.conf\fR(5), but don\(cqt enter \fBruntimecal\fR, it will guesstimate the state of charge by looking at the battery voltage alone\&. This is not reliable under load, as this only gives reasonably accurate readings if you disconnect the load, let the battery rest for a couple of minutes and then measure the open cell voltage\&. This just isn\(cqt practical if the power went out and the UPS is providing power for your systems\&.

There is a way to get better readings without disconnecting the load but this requires one to keep track on how much (and how fast) current is going in and out of the battery\&. If you specified the \fBruntimecal\fR, the driver will attempt to do this\&. Note however, that this heavily relies on the values you enter and that the UPS must be able to report the load as well\&. There are quite a couple of devices that report 0 % (or any other fixed value) at all times, in which case this obviously doesn\(cqt work\&.
.sp
The driver also has no way of determining the degradation of the battery capacity over time, so you\(cqll have to deal with this yourself (by adjusting the values in \fBruntimecal\fR)\&. Also note that the driver guesses the initial state of charge based on the battery voltage, so this may be less than 100 %, even when you are certain that they are full\&. There is just no way to reliably measure this between 0 and 100 % full charge\&.
.sp
This is better than nothing (but not by much)\&. If any of the above calculations is giving you incorrect readings, you are the one that put in the values in \fBups.conf\fR(5), so don\(cqt complain with the author\&. If you need something better, buy a UPS that reports \fBbattery\&.charge\fR and \fBbattery\&.runtime\fR all by itself without the help of a NUT driver\&.
