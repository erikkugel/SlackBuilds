.SH "NAME"
nutdrv_atcl_usb \- Driver for \*(AqATCL FOR UPS\*(Aq equipment
.SH "NOTE"
.sp
This man page only documents the specific features of the nutdrv_atcl_usb driver\&. For information about the core driver, see \fBnutupsdrv\fR(8)\&.
.SH "SUPPORTED HARDWARE"
.sp
This driver is for UPS hardware which identifies itself as USB idVendor 0001 and idProduct 0000, and iManufacturer ATCL FOR UPS\&. Known manufacturers include Kanji and Plexus\&. The UPS interface seems to be a generic USB\-to\-serial chip, and for hardware manufactured by Kanji and Plexus, the microcontroller appears to emulate a traditional contact\-closure interface\&. This translates into only three states in ups\&.status: \fBOL\fR, \fBOB\fR and \fBOB LB\fR (similar to \fBgenericups\fR(8)), with no other dynamic status values reported\&. Note that these USB identifiers (including the iManufacturer string) have also been seen on devices that are supported by the fuji subdriver of \fBnutdrv_qx\fR(8)\&.
.SH "EXTRA ARGUMENTS"
.sp
This driver supports the following optional setting:
.PP
\fBvendor\fR=\fIname\fR
.RS 4
In case your iManufacturer (Vendor) string does not exactly match
ATCL FOR UPS, you may provide an alternate string here\&. Note that a more likely case is that your device is handled by another driver for
0001:0000
devices, such as
\fBnutdrv_qx\fR(8)\&.
.RE
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
The UPS returns the same code for "load power is off" as for "on line power"\&. This condition will not be observed if the NUT master is powered by the UPS, but may be an issue if the UPS is monitored by a remote system\&.
.sp
The time between the shutdown command and removal of power seems to be fixed at 30 seconds\&. Ensure that the NUT shutdown script is invoked as late as possible in the shutdown procedure (in case some services take longer than others to clean up)\&.
.sp
Most contact\-closure UPSes will not power down the load if the line power is present\&. This can create a race when using slave \fBupsmon\fR(8) systems\&. See the \fBupsmon\fR(8) man page for more information\&. The solution to this problem is to upgrade to a smart protocol UPS of some kind that allows detection and proper load cycling on command\&.
