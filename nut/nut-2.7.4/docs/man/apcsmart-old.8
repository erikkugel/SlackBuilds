This man page only documents the hardware\-specific features of the apcsmart\-old driver\&. For information about the core driver, see \fBnutupsdrv\fR(8)\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.SH "SUPPORTED HARDWARE"
.sp
apcsmart\-old should recognize all recent APC models that use a serial protocol at 2400 bps\&. This is primarily the Smart\-UPS, Matrix\-UPS and Back\-UPS Pro lines\&.
.sp
The driver attempts to support every bell and whistle of the APC reporting interface, whether or not this is strictly sensible\&.
.sp
Some older hardware may only report a handful of variables\&. This is usually not a bug\(emthey just don\(cqt support anything else\&.
.SH "CABLING"
.sp
This driver expects to see a 940\-0024C cable or a clone by default\&. You can switch to the 940\-0095B dual\-mode cable support with the cable= definition described below\&.
.sp
If your 940\-0024C cable is broken or missing, use this diagram to build a clone:

.SH "EXTRA ARGUMENTS"

This driver supports the following optional settings in the \fBups.conf\fR(5):
.PP
\fBcable=940\-0095B\fR

Configure the serial port for the APC 940\-0095B dual\-mode cable\&.

"force OB" hack method for CS 350
.RE
.RE
.sp
Modes 0 and 1 will power up the load when power returns\&. Modes 2 and 3 will keep the load turned off when the power returns\&.
.sp
Mode 4 exploits an oddity in the CS 350 models since they only seem to support the S command, but then only when running on battery\&. As a result, the driver will force the UPS to go on battery if necessary before sending the shutdown command\&. This ensures that the load gets reset\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
Some older APC UPS models return bogus data in the status register during a front panel test\&. This is usually detected and discarded, but some other unexpected values have occasionally slipped through\&.
.sp
APC UPS models with both USB and serial ports require a power cycle when switching from USB communication to serial, and perhaps vice versa\&.
.SH "AUTHOR"
.sp
Nigel Metheringham <Nigel\&.Metheringham@Intechnology\&.co\&.uk> (drawing heavily on the original apcsmart driver by Russell Kroll)\&. This driver was called newapc for a time and was renamed in the 1\&.5 series\&. In 2\&.6\&.2 the driver was renamed to apcsmart\-old, being superseded by updated version with new features\&.
