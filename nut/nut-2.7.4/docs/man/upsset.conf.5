.SH "NAME"
upsset.conf \- Configuration for Network UPS Tools upsset\&.cgi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This file only does one job\(emit lets you convince \fBupsset.cgi\fR(8) that your system\(cqs CGI directory is secure\&. The program will not run until this file has been properly defined\&.
.SH "SECURITY REQUIREMENTS"
.sp
\fBupsset.cgi\fR(8) allows you to try login name and password combinations\&. There is no rate limiting, as the program shuts down between every request\&. Such is the nature of CGI programs\&.
.sp
Normally, attackers would not be able to access your \fBupsd\fR(8) server directly as it would be protected by the LISTEN directives in your \fBupsd.conf\fR(5) file, tcp\-wrappers (if available when NUT was built), and hopefully local firewall settings in your OS\&.
.sp
\fBupsset\fR runs on your web server, so upsd will see it as a connection from a host on an internal network\&. It doesn\(cqt know that the connection is actually coming from someone on the outside\&. This is why you must secure it\&.
.sp
On Apache, you can use the \&.htaccess file or put the directives in your httpd\&.conf\&. It looks something like this, assuming the \&.htaccess method:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<Files upsset\&.cgi>
deny from all
allow from your\&.network\&.addresses
</Files>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
You will probably have to set "AllowOverride Limit" for this directory in your server\-level configuration file as well\&.
.sp
If this doesn\(cqt make sense, then stop reading and leave this program alone\&. It\(cqs not something you absolutely need to have anyway\&.
.sp
Assuming you have all this done, and it actually works (test it!), then you may add the following directive to this file:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
I_HAVE_SECURED_MY_CGI_DIRECTORY
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If you lie to the program and someone beats on your upsd through your web server, don\(cqt blame me\&.
