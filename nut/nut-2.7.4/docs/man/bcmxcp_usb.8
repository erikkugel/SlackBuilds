.SH "NAME"
bcmxcp_usb \- Experimental driver for UPSes supporting the BCM/XCP protocol over USB
.SH "NOTE"
.sp
This man page only documents the hardware\-specific features of the bcmxcp_usb driver\&. For information about the core driver, see \fBnutupsdrv\fR(8)\&. This driver is a variant of the serial driver bcmxcp and uses the same core code\&.
.SH "SUPPORTED HARDWARE"
.sp
This driver should recognize all BCM/XCP\-compatible UPSes that are connected via USB\&. It has been developed and tested on Powerware PW3501 hardware\&. It also has been tested on PW5110 hardware\&.
.SH "EXTRA ARGUMENTS"
.sp
This driver supports the following optional settings in the \fBups.conf\fR(5)\&.
.PP
\fBshutdown_delay=\fR\fIdelay\fR
.RS 4
The number of seconds that the UPS should wait between receiving the shutdown command and actually shutting off\&.
.RE
.SH "DEFAULT VALUES FOR THE EXTRA ARGUMENTS"
.sp
\fBshutdown_delay =\fR\fI120\fR
.SH "INSTANT COMMANDS"
.sp
This driver supports the following Instant Commands:
.PP
\fBshutdown\&.return\fR
.RS 4
Turn off the load and return when power is back\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshutdown\&.stayoff\fR
.RS 4
Turn off the load and remain off\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBtest\&.battery\&.start\fR
.RS 4
Start a battery test\&.
.RE
.SH "TODO LIST"
.PP
\fBReport UPS alarm status\fR
.RS 4
BCM/XCP supports reporting a wide range of UPS alarm conditions\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBReport UPS statistics informations\fR
.RS 4
BCM/XCP supports reporting of UPS statistics data\&.
.RE
.SH "EXPERIMENTAL DRIVER"
.sp
This driver has been tagged experimental, even if it has been reported to be stable\&. Thus it is not suitable for production systems and it is not built by default\&. This is mainly due to the fact that it is a new driver\&.
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.sp
This driver is not built by default\&. You can build it by using "configure \-\-with\-usb=yes"\&. Note that it will also install other USB drivers\&.
.sp
You also need to install manually the hotplug files (libhidups and libhid\&.usermap), generally in etc/hotplug/usb/, to address the permission settings problem\&. Lastly note that the libhidups file must have execution flag set (ie using chmod +x \&...)\&.
.SH "IMPLEMENTATION"
.sp
bcmxcp_usb only supports 1 UPS at this time\&. You can put the "auto" value for port in ups\&.conf, i\&.e\&.:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[pw3105]
        driver = bcmxcp_usb
        port = auto
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES AND BUGS"
.SS ""Got EPERM: Operation not permitted upon driver startup""
.sp
You have forgotten to install the hotplug files, as explained in the INSTALLATION section above\&. Don\(cqt forget to restart hotplug so that it applies these changes\&.
