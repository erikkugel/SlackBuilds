.SH "NAME"
blazer_usb \- Driver for Megatec/Q1 protocol USB based UPS equipment
.SH "NOTE"
.sp
This man page only documents the hardware\-specific features of the blazer driver\&. For information about the core driver, see \fBnutupsdrv\fR(8)\&.
.SH "SUPPORTED HARDWARE"
.sp
The blazer driver is known to work with various UPSes from Blazer, Energy Sistem, Fenton Technologies, General Electric, Mustek and many others\&. The NUT compatibility table lists all the known supported models\&. Keep in mind, however, that other models not listed there may also be supported, but haven\(cqt been tested\&.
.sp
All devices with a serial interface (use the \fBblazer_ser\fR driver) and many with a USB interface (use the \fBblazer_usb\fR driver) are supported\&.
.SH "EXTRA ARGUMENTS"
.sp
You may need to override or provide defaults for some values, depending on the make and model of your UPS\&. The following are the ones that most likely will need changing (see \fBups.conf\fR(5)):
.PP
\fBdefault\&.battery\&.voltage\&.high =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Maximum battery voltage that is reached after about 12 to 24 hours charging\&. If you want the driver to report a guesstimated
\fBbattery\&.charge\fR, you need to specify this (see
BATTERY CHARGE)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdefault\&.battery\&.voltage\&.low =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Minimum battery voltage just before the UPS automatically shuts down\&. If you want the driver to report a guesstimated
\fBbattery\&.charge\fR, you need to specify this (see
BATTERY CHARGE)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdefault\&.battery\&.voltage\&.nominal =\fR \fIvalue\fR, \fBoverride\&.battery\&.voltage\&.nominal =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Some devices show a wrong nominal battery voltage (or none at all), so you may need to override or set a default value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBoverride\&.battery\&.packs =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Some devices report a part of the total battery voltage\&. For instance, if
\fBbattery\&.voltage\&.nominal\fR
is 24 V, but it reports a
\fBbattery\&.voltage\fR
of around 2 V, the number of
\fBbattery\&.packs\fR
to correct this reading would be 12\&. The driver will attempt to detect this automatically, but if this fails somehow, you may want to override this value\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBondelay =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Time to wait before switching on the UPS (minutes)\&. Note that a value below 3 minutes, may cause earlier firmware versions to not switch on automatically, so it defaults to 3 minutes\&. The acceptable range is
0\&.\&.9999
minutes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBoffdelay =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Time to wait before shutting down the UPS (seconds)\&. This value is truncated to units of 6 seconds (less than 60 seconds) or 60 seconds (more than 60 seconds)\&. Defaults to 30 seconds\&. The acceptable range is
12\&.\&.600
seconds\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBnorating\fR
.RS 4
Some UPSes will lock up if you attempt to read rating information from them\&. Setting this flag will make the driver skip this step\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBnovendor\fR
.RS 4
Some UPSes will lock up if you attempt to read vendor information from them\&. Setting this flag will make the driver skip this step\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBprotocol =\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Skip autodetection of the protocol to use and only use the one specified\&. Supported values
\fImegatec\fR,
\fImegatec/old\fR,
\fImustek\fR
and
\fIzinto\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBruntimecal =\fR \fIvalue,value,value,value\fR
.RS 4
Parameter used in the (optional) runtime estimation\&. This takes two runtimes at different loads\&. Typically, this uses the runtime at full load and the runtime at half load\&. For instance, if your UPS has a rated runtime of 240 seconds at full load and 720 seconds at half load, you would enter
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
runtimecal = 240,100,720,50
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The first load should always be higher than the second\&. If you have values available for loads other than 100 and 50 % respectively, you can use those too, but keep them spaced apart as far as reasonably possible\&. Just don\(cqt get too close to no load (prediction of runtime depends more on idle load for the battery then)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBchargetime =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
The time needed to fully recharge the battery after being fully discharged\&. If not specified, the driver defaults to 43200 seconds (12 hours)\&. Only used if
\fBruntimecal\fR
is also specified\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBidleload =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Minimum battery load used by the driver to estimate the runtime\&. If not specified, the driver defaults to 10%\&. Only used if
\fBruntimecal\fR
is also specified\&.
.RE
.SS "USB INTERFACE ONLY"
.PP
\fBvendorid =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBproductid =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBvendor =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBproduct =\fR \fIregex\fR, \fBserial =\fR \fIregex\fR
.RS 4
Select a specific UPS, in case there is more than one connected via USB\&. Each option specifies an extended regular expression (see
\fBregex(7)\fR) that must match the UPS\(cqs entire vendor/product/serial string (minus any surrounding whitespace), or the whole 4\-digit hexadecimal code for vendorid and productid\&. Try
\fB\-DD\fR
for finding out the strings to match\&.

.PP
\fBbus =\fR \fIregex\fR
.RS 4
Select a UPS on a specific USB bus or group of busses\&. The argument is a regular expression that must match the bus name where the UPS is connected (e\&.g\&. bus="002", bus="00[2\-3]")\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBsubdriver =\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Select a serial\-over\-USB subdriver to use\&. You have a choice between
\fBphoenix\fR,
\fBippon\fR,
\fBcypress\fR, and
\fBkrauler\fR\&. When using this option, it is mandatory to also specify the
\fBvendorid\fR
and
\fBproductid\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlangid_fix =\fR \fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Apply the language ID workaround to the krauler subdriver\&. This is mandatory for some devices to work (LDLC, Dynamix and others)\&. You must to provide
\fBvalue\fR
(0x409 or 0x4095), according to your device entry in NUT hardware compatibility list (HCL)\&.
.RE

.RE
.SH "BATTERY CHARGE"
.sp
Due to popular demand, this driver will report a guesstimated \fBbattery\&.charge\fR and optionally \fBbattery\&.runtime\fR, provided you specified a couple of the EXTRA ARGUMENTS listed above\&.
.sp
If you specify both \fBbattery\&.voltage\&.high\fR and \fBbattery\&.voltage\&.low\fR in \fBups.conf\fR(5), but don\(cqt enter \fBruntimecal\fR, it will guesstimate the state of charge by looking at the battery voltage alone\&. This is not reliable under load, as this only gives reasonably accurate readings if you disconnect the load, let the battery rest for a couple of minutes and then measure the open cell voltage\&. This just isn\(cqt practical if the power went out and the UPS is providing power for your systems\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
                     battery\&.voltage \- battery\&.voltage\&.low
battery\&.charge =  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- x 100 %
                  battery\&.voltage\&.high \- battery\&.voltage\&.low
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
There is a way to get better readings without disconnecting the load but this requires one to keep track on how much (and how fast) current is going in\- and out of the battery\&. If you specified the \fBruntimecal\fR, the driver will attempt to do this\&. Note however, that this heavily relies on the values you enter and that the UPS must be able to report the load as well\&. There are quite a couple of devices that report 0 % (or any other fixed value) at all times, in which case this obviously doesn\(cqt work\&.
.sp
The driver also has no way of determining the degradation of the battery capacity over time, so you\(cqll have to deal with this yourself (by adjusting the values in \fBruntimecal\fR)\&. Also note that the driver guesses the initial state of charge based on the battery voltage, so this may be less than 100 %, even when you are certain that they are full\&. There is just no way to reliably measure this between 0 and 100 % full charge\&.
.sp
This is better than nothing (but not by much)\&. If any of the above calculations is giving you incorrect readings, you are the one that put in the values in \fBups.conf\fR(5), so don\(cqt complain with the author\&. If you need something better, buy a UPS that reports \fBbattery\&.charge\fR and \fBbattery\&.runtime\fR all by itself without the help of a NUT driver\&.
.SH "NOTES FOR THE PREVIOUS USER OF MEGATEC DRIVERS"
.sp
The blazer drivers having replaced the megatec ones, some configuration changes may be required by users switching to blazer\&.
.sp
Part of this, the following megatec options, in ups\&.conf, have to be changed:
.PP
\fBbattvolts\fR
.RS 4
You need to use
\fIdefault\&.battery\&.voltage\&.high\fR
and
\fIdefault\&.battery\&.voltage\&.low\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBdtr and rts\fR
.RS 4
You need to use
\fIcablepower\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBignoreoff\fR
.RS 4
This parameter can simply be discarded, since it was a wrong understanding of the specification\&.
.RE
.SH "KNOWN PROBLEMS"
.sp
Some UPS commands aren\(cqt supported by all models\&. In most cases, the driver will send a message to the system log when the user tries to execute an unsupported command\&. Unfortunately, some models don\(cqt even provide a way for the driver to check for this, so the unsupported commands will silently fail\&.
.sp
Both the \fBload\&.off\fR and \fBshutdown\&.stayoff\fR instant commands are meant to turn the load off indefinitely\&. However, some UPS models don\(cqt allow this\&.
.sp
Some models report a bogus value for the beeper status (will always be \fIenabled\fR or \fIdisabled\fR)\&. So, the \fBbeeper\&.toggle\fR command may appear to have no effect in the status reported by the driver when, in fact, it is working fine\&.
.sp
The temperature and load value is known to be bogus in some models\&.
