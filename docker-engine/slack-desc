docker-engine: Docker Engine
docker-engine: 
docker-engine: The Docker Engine is a lightweight container runtime and robust
docker-engine: tooling that builds and runs your container. Docker allows you to
docker-engine: package up application code and dependencies together in an isolated
docker-engine: container that share the OS kernel on the host system. The in-host
docker-engine: daemon communicates with the Docker Client to execute commands to
docker-engine: build, ship and run containers.
