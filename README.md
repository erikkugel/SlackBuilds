SlackBuilds for Slackware Linux

Written and maintained by Ernest Kugel (erik dot kugel at gmail dot com)

# Why is this here?
Traditional slackbuilds such as SlackBuilds.org are usually for stable software releases and stable Slackware releases. This repository is meant to supplement those: if you'd like to use the latest source code instead, usually directly from srouce controll, or if you need something that works with rolling Slackware release, or if you need something you cannot find through more traditional channels, this is the place for you.

# Instructions  
Normally, you'd only need to run the appropriate Slackbuild file and the rest will be taken care of: you will end up with a package under /tmp you may then install with `installpkg` or `pkgtool` or `slackpkg --install`
