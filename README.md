SlackBuilds for Slackware Linux

Written and maintained by Ernest Kugel (erik dot kugel at gmail dot com).

# Instructions  
Normally, you'd only need to run the appropriate Slackbuild file and the rest will be taken care of: you will end up with a package under /tmp you may then install with `installpkg` or `pkgtool`
